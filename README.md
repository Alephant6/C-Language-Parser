# C-Language-Parser

This project is mainly to write a simple parser that recognizes C-language declarations and prints out their types in natural language according to the  C11 standard draft: [ISO/IEC 9899:201x (open-std.org)](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1548.pdf), which replaced the C99 standard draft: [ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (open-std.org)](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf) in 2011. The project involves using [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/), which is a very stable and powerful tool for processing LL syntax, and the code generated by it has high performance, to generate Java code files. The project uses [C.g4](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/c) which is the officially written C-language grammar ANTLR file rather than creating a grammar file to define its syntax,  and mainly writes codes in Java to convert C-language declarations into natural language descriptions.

## Require  

1. a simple parser for recognizing the type of a C-language declaration  
   1. parse common use cases  
      1. C99 standard here: [ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (open-std.org)](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf)  
      2. C11 standard here: [ISO/IEC 9899:201x (open-std.org)](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1548.pdf)
      2. clause 6.2.5 on page 33 and clause 6.7 on page 97  
   2. any storage class specifiers (extern, static or volatile)  
      1. do not consider  
   3. special rules  
      1. the C99 standard draft, clause 6.7.5.3, # 7 and # 8 for details.  
   4. implicit return type   
      1. do not have to consider  
   5. variadic function parameters in function declarations  
      1. do not have to consider  
2. [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) in Java  
   1. a parser generator  
   2. a tutorial and a description of  the LL grammar
3. the report  
   1. understanding of the problem  
   2. approaches
4. source code

## A few sample inputs and outputs  

Input 1:  

```C  
int x;  
```

Output 1:  

```C  
int  
```

  

Input 2:  

```C  
int x[2];  
```

Output 2:  

```C  
size-2 array of int  
```

  

Input 3:  

```C  
int *x[2];  
```

Output 3:  

```C  
size-2 array of pointer to int  
```

  

Input 4:  

```C  
int f(int x, float *y);  
```

Output 4:  

```C  
function that accepts (int and pointer to float) returning int  
```

  

Input 5:  

```C  
int (*f)(int x, float *);  
```

Output 5:  

```C  
pointer to function that accepts (int and pointer to float) returning int  
```

  

Input 6:  

```C  
int (*f[2])(int x, float *);  
```

Output 6:  

```C  
size-2 array of pointer to function that accepts (int and pointer to float) returning int  
```
